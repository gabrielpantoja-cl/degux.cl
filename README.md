# Reference Database for Appraisal 📊
Project developed with Next.js 15.2.0 App Router

## Project Status
🚧 **Under active development** 🚧

### Currently Working On:
- Strengthening the authentication system with Google 🔒
- Optimizing the reference entry form 📝

## Description
Management system for real estate appraisal references with:
- Authentication via Google OAuth 2.0 🔐
- Protected admin panel 🛡️
- Reference management (create, read, update, delete) 📋
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM and PostGIS extension for spatial data 🗺️

In the initial phase, we focus on collaboratively creating the database 🤝.

## Known Issues 🐛
- On mobile view, next image does not optimize the home image properly 📱
- When creating a new reference, a duplicate success message appears 📨
- **Pagination in the Referenciales table is broken in production.  Navigating between pages does not update the table UI. This is a known issue, and we are actively working to resolve it. 🚧**

## In Development 🚀
- Implementation of robust error handling 🛠️
- Caching system to improve performance ⚡

## Database 🗄️
We use PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM with the PostGIS extension. The current schema includes:
